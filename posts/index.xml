      <description>At work a need arose for migrating a project with 4 years worth of history from our on premise TFS to the online visual studio team services (VSTS), completing the migration, I though I would share the workflow and steps for migrating a project from local TFS to VSTS, and the gotchas and consideration you need to be aware of.
But first, Why would you want to migrate? It could be for couple of reasons, one of them is to tap into the up to date features of the online VSTS, while the on-premise offering of TFS gets updated, the cadence at which the online counterpart gets updated are much much higher.</description>
