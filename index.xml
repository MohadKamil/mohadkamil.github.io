      <description>Automating deployment tasks is one of the pivotal operations in DevOps, lifting the repetitive tasks will allow the developers to focus on the thing they are good at, which is writing code, and will yield a deployment mechanism that is repetitive and error-prone.
And the area we want to automate today is the deployment of a WPF application, specifically the creation and publishing of a ClickOnce package, in this post I will demo one way of accomplishing this task, and in a future one, another method will be used.</description>

      <description>Just the other day, I wanted to run a static analysis on a project I am working on, to know the number of lines of codes mainly, and to see other metrics.
There are good static analysis tools out there, and the one we had a pleasurable experience with at work is sonarqube, so I went with it, but sonarqube is a server application and requires some dependencies to run, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to install java runtime just to know the number of my project code lines, what could be the solution?</description>

      <title>VSTS as CMS</title>

      <description>Blogging for the duration of two posts -that&amp;rsquo;s a long time in blog years :)-, I thought I would share the blogging platform I use, and it would be good to talk about the steps required to publish a post, for me I came to choose and love hugo to build this blog, Hugo is static site generator written in go, the idea is simple but powerful, you write your content in markdown and through Hugo these posts (or whatever content) get compiled to static code -HTML,CSS and javascript in the case of web-, having your blog served as only static files makes it super fast and it plays great with CDN like Cloudflare which I am planning on using in the near future.</description>

      <title>Migrating to VSTS</title>

      <description>At work a need arose for migrating a project with 4 years worth of history from our on-premise TFS to the online visual studio team services (VSTS), completing the migration, I thought I would share the workflow and steps for migrating a project from local TFS to VSTS, and the gotchas and consideration you need to be aware of.
But first, Why would you want to migrate? It could be for a couple of reasons, one of them is to tap into the up to date features of the online VSTS, while the on-premise offering of TFS gets updated, the cadence at which the online counterpart gets updated is much much higher.</description>
